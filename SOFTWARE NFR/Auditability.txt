Auditability	In the design stage, the key content of supervision is to conduct detailed, careful and careful review of the design plan.
Auditability	The supervision tasks in the coding phase are mainly to review the personnel, equipment, and schedule of the project team to ensure that software engineering development can be carried out smoothly in accordance with the schedule.
Auditability	In the construction of a tax management system, in order to effectively control the quality of the project, the supervision unit attaches great importance to the review of the demand analysis results in the demand writing link.
Auditability	The need analysis book is established in the form of text records, and the customer is required to review the need analysis book in order to achieve a result that is highly consistent with the real expectations of the customer.
Auditability	Requirements changes must be proposed by a unified person in charge and approved by the review leader of user requirements.
Auditability	After the supplier information is collected, the procurement specialist can be arranged to conduct inspections, qualification review and classification of the suppliers to facilitate the formulation of later procurement strategies and the development of procurement work.
Auditability	The contracting party should promptly and fully analyze the contents of the plan, and should compare and review it in detail with the enterprise's plan, so as to understand whether the outsourcer's arrangement of the entire project and resources matches the requirements of the project itself.
Auditability	Strict legal provisions and strict contract review are used to protect intellectual property rights and commercial secrets.
Auditability	The supervision during the project initiation phase consists of reviewing the project components, the project implementation plan and the project implementation plan submitted by the developer.
Auditability	Supervise the design of system architecture, division of functional modules and business logic, database logic and physical design, object class and object interface design, authority allocation mechanism, interface design, etc. according to the Requirements Specifications, and review the generated design diagrams and documents.
Auditability	The supervisor should review the test plans and test cases of the developer, regularly check the test records, etc., sample and estimate the number of errors according to the test cases, and deploy in the running environment only after meeting the requirements.
Auditability	After the supervisor verifies that the deployment plan is qualified, he first deploys software and hardware operating environment in the user unit, installs software, carries out necessary configuration and debugging, loads experimental data, and then formally deploys it after passing the operation audit.
Auditability	The statistical measurement data of the system is strictly based on the real data generated by the system for statistical analysis, and the system provides the function of reviewing and verifying the analysis and statistical results.
Auditability	Check and review the development scope of the Requirements Specification based on the User Requirements Specification.
Auditability	When reviewing the Requirements Specification, at least example diagrams, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, etc. should be used, and the information to be expressed should be grasped by the three elements of the basic and structured methods.
Auditability	Use case diagrams clearly reflect roles and use cases, and can correspond to the main functional items in the business flow, usually the use cases will be transformed into program menus, mainly used for auditing and checking the business scope.
Auditability	The sequence diagram is used to review and check the granularity of the sequence diagram, which basically corresponds to the business process and data flow.
